## Abstract

This research investigates the anion selectivity mechanisms of the glycine receptor (GlyR) channel using molecular dynamics simulations and umbrella sampling techniques. Building upon previous work, this study examines the conductance properties and ion permeation characteristics of the transmembrane domain under various applied potentials, validating and extending the findings of Dr. Seiferth regarding GlyR channel properties. 

Potential of mean force (PMF) calculations reveal substantially higher free energy barriers for cations compared to chloride ions, providing a quantitative basis for the channel's anion selectivity. Additionally, a significant interaction between chloride ions and the K292 residue at the extracellular end of the truncated transmembrane domain was identified using hydration shell plots, highlighting limitations in using simplified channel models for MD simulations. 

These findings demonstrate both the utility and limitations of computational approaches in understanding ion channel selectivity mechanisms.
